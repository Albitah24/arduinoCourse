# Epilog Laser Tutorial (from Castelldefels Tinkerers lab)

This documentation is about how to use the Epilog laser. 

This is intended for people who are already familiar with other laser cutting machines. But I'll try to keep it accessible. 

## Epilog laser 

This beauty is small but very good. It has limited cutting power but it's cozy and functional. Beware that it won't cut in one run a 5mm acrylic. 

Right now is installed in one of the computers but it's connected through network so it could be installed ino all of them or other computers if you share the network. 

## Safety first

_Bioroids now that safety comes first_

Ok, so safety first. To operate the laser (or any laser) you should know that

* Things can catch fire and/or produce fumes.

So you should check out where is the fire extinguisher (right now is next to the laser). 

Also you should be always near the lasercut when it's cutting. If you have to go to the bathroom, you have to stop the machine, go to attend the body's duty, and then resume the job. 

Also you have to start the auxiliary systems _before_ starting cutting. That is the compressor (right now it's on the CNC side) and the extractor (it's on the right of the lasercut, like a meter away). 

## Starting the machine. 

This machine is disconnected fully from the current when it's out so it deletes the previous jobs. So you have to plug and unplug it to turn it on or off. It will start the routine of start and it' will be ready to go.
